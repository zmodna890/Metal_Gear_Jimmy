# Metal Gear Jimmy with LÖVE2D
## Description
Metal Gear Jimmy is based on the game Metal Gear Solid from Konami. The gameplay is a simple maze with a starting point, and your goal is to escape the maze while avoiding the surveillance cameras. If you would like to try out the game without downloading LÖVE or any program, you may play the [web version here](https://zmodna890.github.io).

## Requirements
- [LÖVE 11.0 or newer](https://love2d.org/#download)

## LÖVE
LÖVE is a 2D Game Engine, used to make 2D games in Lua. It's free, open-source, and works on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS. [Download LÖVE here.](https://love2d.org/#download)

## Disclaimer
This game is not an accurate representation of Metal Gear Solid from Konami. The gameplay is not made by me, but is heavily inspired by a UNLV Fall 2023 Assignment called Metal Gear Jimmy, made by Dr. Benjamin Cisneros-Merino. The gameplay was simple and originally text-based, and I just turned the gameplay into a 2D game.

None of the sprites and sounds were made by me. If you are an owner of an image/sprite being used in this project and you would like to get credit, please send me a message on Discord: `zmodna`.
